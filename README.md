# rwsdk-jsx-stream
React Server Components (RSC) can generate streams of JSX components. This extends the more common pattern of one HTTP request returning a single server-rendered component.

For the Next.js version, see [nextjs-jsx-stream](https://github.com/jldec/next-jsx-stream).

This is a [RedwoodSDK](https://docs.rwsdk.com/) project bootstrapped with [`jldec/rwsdk-minimal-starter`](https://github.com/jldec/rwsdk-minimal-starter).
